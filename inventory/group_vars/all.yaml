# CloudLens Deployment Variables Template
# Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration

# General CloudLens Configuration
cloudlens_manager_ip_or_FQDN: "<YOUR_CLOUDLENS_MANAGER_IP_OR_FQDN>"  # Example: "cloudlens.company.com" or "192.168.1.100"
project_key: "<YOUR_PROJECT_KEY>"  # Your CloudLens project key (32-character hex string)
custom_tags: "<YOUR_CUSTOM_TAGS>"  # Example: "Env=Production Region=US-East Team=DevOps"
cloudlens_agent_container_name: "cloudlens-agent" 

# Registry Configuration
registry_type: "<insecure_or_secure>"  # Set to "insecure" for HTTP or "secure" for HTTPS with certificates
local_ca_path: "<PATH_TO_CA_CERTIFICATE>"  # Full path to CA certificate file (only needed for secure registry)
                                           # Example: "/path/to/your/cloudlenscerts.crt"
ca_cert_dir: "<CA_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY>"  # Directory for CA certificates on target hosts
                                           # Ubuntu default: "/etc/ssl/certs"
                                           # RHEL/CentOS default: "/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors"

# Log Rotation Settings
log_max_size: "50m"  # Maximum size of log file before rotation (e.g., "50m", "100m", "1g")
log_max_file: "5"  # Number of rotated log files to keep (e.g., "5", "10")

# Python Interpreter Configuration (if needed)
# Uncomment and set the appropriate interpreter for your target systems
# ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3        # Common for modern Ubuntu/Debian
# ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/libexec/platform-python  # RHEL 8/CentOS 8
# ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python         # Legacy systems

# Notes:
# 1. cloudlens_manager_ip_or_FQDN: This should be the IP address or fully qualified domain name 
#    of your CloudLens Manager server
#
# 2. project_key: This is a unique identifier for your CloudLens project. You can obtain this
#    from your CloudLens Manager dashboard
#
# 3. custom_tags: These are key-value pairs used to tag and organize your CloudLens agents.
#    Use format "Key1=Value1 Key2=Value2" with spaces between pairs
#
# 4. registry_type: 
#    - Use "insecure" if your CloudLens Manager uses HTTP or self-signed certificates
#    - Use "secure" if your CloudLens Manager has proper SSL certificates
#
# 5. local_ca_path: Only required when registry_type is "secure". This should be the full path
#    to your CA certificate file on your Ansible control machine
#
# 6. ca_cert_dir: The directory where CA certificates are stored on target hosts. This varies
#    by operating system:
#    - Ubuntu/Debian: /etc/ssl/certs
#    - RHEL/CentOS/Fedora: /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
#
# 7. Python interpreter: Only uncomment if Ansible cannot automatically detect the correct
#    Python interpreter on your target hosts
