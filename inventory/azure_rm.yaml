# âœ… RECOMMENDATION TO TEAM:
  # Ensure that all deployed VMs are tagged appropriately, especially with an 'Env' tag
  # (e.g., Env=dev, Env=qa, Env=prod). This enables reliable grouping and targeting
  # for configuration management and automation tasks in Ansible.
  #
  # Tagging based on environment helps separate dev/test/staging/prod resources, avoids accidental cross-env changes,
  # and improves reporting, auditing, and governance across Azure resources.
