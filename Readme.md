# CloudLens Agent Deployment with Ansible

## Overview

This repository provides fully automated Ansible playbooks for deploying the CloudLens Agent across various platforms:

- **Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS)** ‚Äì Docker or Podman-based container deployment.
- **Windows** ‚Äì `.exe` silent installation over WinRM.

The automation covers every step from initial setup to agent health validation:

- ‚úÖ Container engine installation (Docker or Podman)  
- ‚úÖ Registry trust configuration and authentication  
- ‚úÖ Deployment of the agent (container or executable)  
- ‚úÖ Structured logging, health checks, and clean-up routines  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This deployment framework supports scaling to thousands of servers across hybrid infrastructures using either static inventories, dynamic inventory plugins, **Ansible Tower/AWX**, and is optimized for **NSX-T** managed environments.

---

## üìà Scaling Deployments

For large-scale infrastructure:
- Use dynamic inventories leveraging **NSX-T tags** and **vCenter inventory**
- Integrate with **Ansible Tower** for centralized job management and scheduling
- Use `constructed.yaml` to group VMs dynamically based on NSX-T security tags and logical constructs
- Leverage Tower's **survey features** for parameterized deployments

## üèóÔ∏è Ansible Tower Configuration

### Setting Up Job Templates

1. **Create Inventory Source**
   - Type: VMware vCenter
   - Source Variables: Include NSX-T tag filtering
   - Update on Launch: Yes

2. **Create Job Templates**
   ```yaml
   # Example Job Template Configuration
   Name: Deploy CloudLens - Ubuntu
   Inventory: NSX-T Dynamic Inventory
   Project: CloudLens Deployment
   Playbook: playbooks/ubuntu.yaml
   Credentials: 
     - SSH Credential
     - Vault Credential
   Extra Variables:
     cloudlens_version: "{{ survey_cloudlens_version }}"
   ```

3. **Configure Surveys** for parameterized deployments
   - CloudLens version selection
   - Environment targeting (dev/staging/prod)
   - Registry selection

## Connectivity test and Deployment Commands

### For Tower/AWX Users

Use the Tower UI to:
1. Launch job templates for deployment
2. Monitor real-time job output
3. Schedule recurring deployments
4. Set up workflow templates for multi-stage deployments

### For CLI Users

## see host mapping
```bash
ansible-inventory -i inventory/nsxt_inventory.yaml --list | jq
```

---

## üì¶ Unified Deployment & Cleanup Playbooks

To simplify execution across all environments, two master playbooks are provided:

---

### ‚úÖ `deploy.yaml` ‚Äì Unified Deployment

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ deploy.yaml
```

### For unified cleanup:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ cleanup.yaml
```

# For specific playbooks use below: 

### Ubuntu Linux Deployment
```bash
ansible ubuntu_prod_vms -i inventory/ -m ping #test connections to ubuntu vms

ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/ubuntu.yaml   #deploy
```

### RHEL/CentOS Deployment
```bash
ansible redhat_prod_vms -i inventory/ -m ping  #test connection

ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/redhat.yaml   #deploy
```

### Windows Deployment
```bash
ansible windows_prod_vms -i inventory/ -m win_ping #test connection

ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/windows.yaml   #deploy
```

### Cleanup Commands
```bash
# Ubuntu
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/ubuntu_cleanup.yaml 

# RHEL/CentOS
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/redhat_cleanup.yaml 

# Windows
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/windows_cleanup.yaml 
```

##  Ansible Logging Details

The Ansible configuration enables centralized logging of all playbook executions with the following setting in `ansible.cfg`:

```ini
log_path = ./ansible.log
```

### üìç Location
All logs are written to:
```bash
./ansible.log
```

### üîç What This Log Contains
- SSH connection events
- Task execution results and errors
- Python interpreter discovery info
- Module stack traces and debug output
- Warnings and tracebacks

### üßë‚Äçüîß Use Cases
- Troubleshooting failed playbooks
- Reviewing debug information
- Providing an audit trail of Ansible executions
- Diagnosing interpreter or module compatibility issues

### üóº Tower Integration
When using Ansible Tower, logs are also available in:
- Tower Job Output UI
- Tower Database (for historical analysis)
- Exported via Tower API for external logging systems

--

## Useful Commands

- Dry run:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yaml --syntax-check
```

- Set interpreter explicitly:
```ini
[all:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```

## Known Issues and Fixes

### RHEL Compatibility Issues

> **‚ö†Ô∏è RHEL Version Compatibility Warning:**  
> **Ansible 2.18** has known compatibility issues with **RHEL 7/8** due to Python version requirements and dependency conflicts. **Ansible 2.16** is the recommended stable version for RHEL environments.

[Ansible-core 2.16 Porting Guide ‚Äî Ansible Community Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.16.html)

#### RHEL 7 Issues with Ansible 2.18:
- **Python 3.6 incompatibility** - Ansible 2.18 requires Python 3.8+
- **Collection dependency conflicts** with older package versions
- **SELinux policy issues** with newer Ansible modules

#### RHEL 8/9 Recommended Approach:
- Use **Ansible 2.16** for maximum compatibility
- Install via **EPEL repositories** for tested packages
- Use **Python 3.9+** when available

### NSX-T Specific Issues

- **Tag synchronization delays:**
> NSX-T tags may take 30-60 seconds to propagate. Consider adding wait tasks or retry logic.

- **API rate limiting:**
> Large environments may hit NSX-T API limits. Use Tower's throttling features.

- **Broken pipe / shared connection closed:**
> Typically SSH or resource timeout. Retry or increase timeout in `ansible.cfg`

- **`SyntaxError: future feature annotations is not defined`:**
> Ensure Python 3.6+ is used on control and target nodes

- **Podman directory errors:**
> Ensure `/var/tmp/cloudtap` and `/var/log/cloudlens` exist before container run

---

## Optional Cleanup (Post-Install)

### For Windows
```yaml
- name: Remove installer from temp
  win_file:
    path: "C:\\temp\\{{ cloudlens_installer_filename }}"
    state: absent
```

### For RHEL/CentOS
Use `redhat_cleanup.yaml` to:
- Remove container
- Remove image
- Delete registry configuration
- Remove CA cert and cloudtap/log folders

---

## üéØ Best Practices for NSX-T Environments

1. **Use NSX-T Security Tags** for dynamic grouping:
   - `Environment`: dev/staging/prod
   - `OS`: ubuntu/rhel/windows
   - `CloudLens`: enabled/disabled

2. **Leverage Tower Workflows** for:
   - Pre-deployment validation
   - Staged rollouts by environment
   - Post-deployment health checks

3. **Monitor via Tower Dashboard**:
   - Job success rates
   - Deployment times
   - Failed host patterns

# Note

You should install pywinrm on your Host because:

üîß **Ansible Always Runs from the Control Node (Your PC/Tower)**
Ansible is agentless ‚Äî it connects remotely to Windows (via WinRM) or Linux (via SSH).

So, all required Ansible Python packages (including pywinrm) must be installed on the machine where you're running Ansible ‚Äî which is your PC or Ansible Tower server.

The Windows VMs just need to have WinRM enabled and reachable.

```bash
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
```
